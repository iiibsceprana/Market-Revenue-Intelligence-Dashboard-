## Project Insight
Laptop and Mobile categories contributed the highest portion of the total revenue.

Top cities contributing to sales include Hyderabad, Delhi, and Bangalore.

Dell XPS 13, OnePlus 8 Pro, and Sony WH-1000XM4 emerged as top-performing products.

Bruce, Amar, and Aryan were the highest contributing sales representatives.

Revenue peaks were seen in April, July, October, and December due to festival and seasonal demand.

Quarter 4 had the highest revenue percentage.

## Final Conclusion:
To improve marketplace sales further, a strategic focus should be placed on high-performing product categories such as Laptops and Mobiles. Additionally, targeted marketing campaigns should be directed towards high-contributing cities like Hyderabad, Delhi, and Bangalore. Seasonal promotions and personalized offers during peak months such as October and December can further boost sales performance. Strengthening the performance of mid-level sales representatives and optimizing product listings can also enhance overall marketplace revenue.
